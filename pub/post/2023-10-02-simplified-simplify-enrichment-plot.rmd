```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    error = FALSE,
    tidy  = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.width = 5,
    fig.height = 5,
    fig.align = "center"
)
options("width" = 100)
```

The `lt` object contains a list of GO enrichment tables. 

```{r, message = FALSE, results = "hide", echo = FALSE}
library(cola)
data(golub_cola) 
res = golub_cola["ATC:skmeans"]

library(hu6800.db)
x = hu6800ENTREZID
mapped_probes = mappedkeys(x)
id_mapping = unlist(as.list(x[mapped_probes]))

lt = functional_enrichment(res, k = 3, id_mapping = id_mapping)
```

```{r}
names(lt)
head(lt[[1]][, 1:7])
```

We first demonstrate the new plot on the single enrichment table. To use the **simplifyEnrichment** package,
we extract significant GO terms, and then call `simplifyGO()`.

```{r, fig.width = 7*1.2, fig.height = 4*1.2}
library(simplifyEnrichment)
df = lt[[1]]
go_id = df$ID[df$p.adjust < 0.01]
simplifyGO(go_id)
```

The plot looks good, but it still contains too many graphic contents. For example, the GO similarity heatmap
is useful, but it takes too much space on the final plot. Here I developed a new function `summarizeGO()` which
simplifies the enrichment results even more. The idea is that since we already have the GO clusters, with a certain
statistic of enrichment, we can simply use its average for the GO cluster.

In the following example, we use `-log10(p.adjust)` as an enrichment measure. The heights of bars correspond to
the mean of `-log10(p.adjust)` of GO terms in different GO clusters. On the left side, we still use the word clouds which
efficiently show the general functions in each GO cluster.

```{r, fig.width = 6*1.2, fig.height = 4*1.4}
l = df$p.adjust < 0.01
summarizeGO(df$ID[l], -log10(df$p.adjust)[l], axis_label = "average -log10(p.adjust)")
```

GO IDs can be attached to the numeric value vector, but this time, the `value` argument
should be explicitely specified when calling `summarizeGO()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
v = -log10(df$p.adjust)
names(v) = df$ID
summarizeGO(value = v[l], axis_label = "average -log10(p.adjust)")
```


Beside `-log10(p.adjust)`, we also suggest to use log2 fold enrichment as the enrichment measure. It is calculated as

$$ \log_2 \left( \frac{k/m_1}{m_2/n} \right) $$

where $k$ is the number of DE genes (if the genes of interest are DE genes) in
a gene set, $m_1$ is the size of DE genes, $m_2$ is the size of the gene set,
$n$ is the total number of genes in the universal set. Of course, the definition
of $m_1$ and $m_2$ can be switched.

```{r, fig.width = 6*1.2, fig.height = 4*1.4}
k = as.numeric(gsub("/\\d+$", "", df$GeneRatio))
m1 = as.numeric(gsub("^\\d+/", "", df$GeneRatio))
m2 = as.numeric(gsub("/\\d+$", "", df$BgRatio))
n = as.numeric(gsub("^\\d+/", "", df$BgRatio))
log2_fold_enrichment = log2(k*n/m1/m2)

summarizeGO(df$ID[l], log2_fold_enrichment[l], axis_label = "average log2(fold_enrichment)")
```

Of course, you can construct a named `log2_fold_enrichment` vector which only contains significant GO terms.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(log2_fold_enrichment) = df$ID
summarizeGO(value = log2_fold_enrichment[l], axis_label = "average log2(fold_enrichment)")
```

For multiple GO enrichment results, `simplifyGOFromMultipleLists()` can be used to visualize and compare GO clusters.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height = 6, out.width = "100%"}
simplifyGOFromMultipleLists(lt, padj_cutoff = 0.001)
```

`summarizeGO()` can also be used to simplify such plot. Now the value of `value` is a list of numeric named vectors which contains
significant GO terms in each enrichment table:

```{r, fig.width = 6*1.2, fig.height = 4*1.8}
value = lapply(lt, function(df) {
    v = -log10(df$p.adjust)
    names(v) = df$ID
    v[df$p.adjust < 0.001]
})
summarizeGO(value = value, axis_label = "average -log10(p.adjust)", legend_title = "-log10(p.adjust)")
```


```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
