```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    error = FALSE,
    tidy  = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.align = "center"
)
```

In the interactive heatmap produced by **InteractiveComplexHeatmap** package,
the sub-heatmap is just a zooming of the main heatmap, which means, if
`cell_fun` or `layer_fun` is set in `Heatmap()`, both main heatmap and
sub-heatmap will execute it. `cell_fun` and `layer_fun` provides a way to
customize the heatmap cells, but when the main heatmap is huge, adding more
graphics via `cell_fun`/`layer_fun` apparently is not a good idea. Users may
want to suppress `cell_fun`/`layer_fun` (or just draw very simple graphics
which will not disturb the reading of the heatmap) in the main heatmap, while only to execute them in
the sub-heatmap.

Now in **InteractiveComplexHeatmap**, there is a new function `is_in_sub_heatmap()` which 
tells whether the current environment is in main heatmap or in the sub heatmap. This 
function can be used inside `cell_fun`/`layer_fun` so that users can decide which graphics
are only drawn for sub-heatmaps.

In the following example, I defined a `cell_fun` which draws cells as round rectangles, and only in the sub-heatmap, 
the values in the matrix are added as text labels.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap)
library(ComplexHeatmap)

m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)

ht = Heatmap(m, rect_gp = gpar(type = "none"),
    show_row_dend = FALSE, show_column_dend = FALSE,
    cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, fill) {
        grid.roundrect(x, y, w, h, r = unit(0.2, "snpc"),
            gp = gpar(col = "white", fill = fill, lwd = 2))
        
        if(is_in_sub_heatmap()) {
            grid.text(round(m[i, j], 1), x, y)
        }
    })
