title: "Set cell width/height in the heatmap"

When making a heatmap, the width and height of heatmap cells are automatically
adjusted to fill in the figure (e.g. the following figure), which means, when
you change the width and height of the final figure, the width and height of
the cells change accordingly.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    error = FALSE,
    tidy  = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.align = "center"
)
options(width = 100)
```


```{r}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
set.seed(123)
mat = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
Heatmap(mat, name = "mat")
```


When the matrix is small, there are scenarios where you might want to manually
set the width and height of cells to fixed values, so that you can, _e.g._,
put proper row/column labels or to make it easy to compare to other heatmaps
with different dimensions.

In `Heatmap()` function, **the total width and height of the heatmap body**
can be controlled by the `width` and `height` arguments, which means you can
control the size of the whole heatmap by setting proper values to these two
arguments. _E.g._ setting `width` to `ncol(mat)*unit(5, "mm")` and `height` to
`nrow(mat)*unit(5, "mm")` ensures the cells to be 5mm for both width and
height.

To save the plot into an figure file, one problem arising is you need to
properly calculate the size of the figure to completely place the plot, or
else the plot is either clipped or there has white spaces around the plot.

In the following figures, the size of the figure is larger than the size of
the heatmap. A black border is added to show the size of the figure.

<style>
img {
	border: 1px black solid;
}
</style>


```{r}
Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", 
	width = ncol(mat)*unit(5, "mm"), 
	height = nrow(mat)*unit(5, "mm"))
```


In **ComplexHeatmap**, the size of the heatmap (including dendrograms, titles
and legends, ...) can be retrieved by `ComplexHeatmap:::width()` and
`ComplexHeatmap:::height()` functions. Note these two functions currently are
not exported, so you need to use `:::` to use them.

To use `ComplexHeatmap:::width()` and `ComplexHeatmap:::height()`, you first
need to explicitly execute `draw()` function to perform clustering and
initialize the layout, then `ComplexHeatmap:::width()` and
`ComplexHeatmap:::height()` and be applied and they return the corresponding
width and height as `grid::unit` objects in mm. You can convert to any other
units by `grid::convertX()` and `grid::convertY()` functions.

```{r, fig.show = "hide"}
ht = Heatmap(mat, , name = "mat", 
	width = ncol(mat)*unit(5, "mm"), 
	height = nrow(mat)*unit(5, "mm"))
ht = draw(ht) # it generates a plot, but we don't show here
w = ComplexHeatmap:::width(ht)
w = convertX(w, "inch", valueOnly = TRUE)
h = ComplexHeatmap:::height(ht)
h = convertY(h, "inch", valueOnly = TRUE)
c(w, h)
```

Now `w` and `h` are the sizes of the heatmap, measured in inches which you can
set in `pdf()` function. If you save the plot as a PNG plot, then you need to
convert `w` and `h` to a unit of `pt` (see the help page of `grid::unit`).

```{r, fig.width = w, fig.height = h}
# pdf(..., width = w, height = h)
Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", 
	width = ncol(mat)*unit(5, "mm"), 
	height = nrow(mat)*unit(5, "mm"))
# dev.off()
```

The calculation of heatmap size actually can be wrapped as a function, which
takes a `Heatmap` or `HeatmapList` object as input and returns the
corresponding width and height.

In the following `calc_ht_size()` function, since we don't need the first
heatmap, we put it into a null device defined by `pdf(NULL)`.

```{r}
calc_ht_size = function(ht, unit = "inch") {
	pdf(NULL)
	ht = draw(ht)
	w = ComplexHeatmap:::width(ht)
	w = convertX(w, unit, valueOnly = TRUE)
	h = ComplexHeatmap:::height(ht)
	h = convertY(h, unit, valueOnly = TRUE)
	dev.off()

	c(w, h)
}
```

Now we can try to use `calc_ht_size()`.

```{r}
ht = Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", 
		width = ncol(mat)*unit(5, "mm"), 
		height = nrow(mat)*unit(5, "mm"))
size = calc_ht_size(ht)
size
```


```{r, fig.width = size[1], fig.height = size[2]}
# pdf(..., width = size[1], height = size[2])
ht
# dev.off()
```

Similar for a smaller matrix:

```{r}
mat2 = mat[1:5, 1:5]
ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = "mat2", 
		width = ncol(mat2)*unit(5, "mm"), 
		height = nrow(mat2)*unit(5, "mm"))
size2 = calc_ht_size(ht2)
size2
```


```{r, fig.width = size2[1], fig.height = size2[2]}
# pdf(..., width = size2[1], height = size2[2])
ht2 # or draw(ht2)
# dev.off()
```
