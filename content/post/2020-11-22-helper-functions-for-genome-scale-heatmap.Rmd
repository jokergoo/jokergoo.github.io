[In my previous blog
post](https://jokergoo.github.io/2020/10/29/make-genome-scale-heatmap/), I
demonstrated how to make a genome-scale heatmap with multiple other tracks.
The key thing there is to split the genome into bins and to normalize various
genomic signals to average them into every bin of the genome. From
**ComplexHeatmap** version 2.7.1.1003, I added some helper functions which
simplify the binning of the genome and the overlapping between genomic bins
and genomic signals with two new functions `bin_genome()` and
`normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()`. Here I will introduce the usage of
these two functions.

The usage of `bin_genome()` is very straightforward. You just select the
genome and bin size, and optional, a subset of chromosomes.

```{r}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
chr_window = bin_genome("hg19")
chr_window
```

The returned value `chr_window` is a `GRanges` object which contains the
genomic bins.

There are several parameters you can set in `bin_genome()`.

- `species`: Abbreviation of the genome, _e.g._, "hg19" or "mm10".
- `bins`: Number of bins to split the genome. The final number will be
  approximately equal to this number. `bins` is for calculating a proper
  `bin_size` value.
- `bin_size`: The bin size. If it is set, `bins` is ignored.
- `...`: All the other arguments are passed to `circlize::read.chromInfo()`,
  _e.g._ you can set the genome by a data frame if it is not available on UCSC
  database, or you can set a subset of chromosomes by `chromosome.index`
  argument.

The second function `normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()`, as the name tells, is
for normalizing the genomic signals to the genomic bins. The usage is:

```r
x = normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins(gr, value, value_column, method, empty_value)
```

The arguments are:

- `gr`: A `GRanges` object.
- `value`: The corresponding signals corresponding to `gr`.
- `value_column`: If `value` is not set and the values are in the meta-columns
  in `gr`, you can specify the column indices for these value columns, better
  to use name indices. 
- `method`: One of "weighted", "w0" and "absolute". For the
  three different methods, please refer to
  https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EnrichedHeatmap/inst/doc/EnrichedHeatmap.html#toc_7 or [my previous blog post](https://jokergoo.github.io/2020/10/29/make-genome-scale-heatmap/)
- `empty_value` The value for the bins where no signal is overlapped.

It supports following values:

- When neither `value` nor `value_column` is set, it simply overlaps `gr`
  to the genomic bins and returns a one-column logical matrix which represents
  whether the current genomic bin overlaps to any signal.
- When the signals are numeric, `value` can be a numeric vector or a matrix,
  or `value_column` can contain multiple columns. The function returns a
  numeric matrix where the values are properly averaged depending on what
  `method` was used.
- When the signals are character, `value` can only be a vector or
  `value_column` can only contain one single column. The function returns a
  one-column character matrix.

You don't need to provide the the genomic bins for
`normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()` because when `bin_genome()` is executed,
the genomic bins are saved internally, so every use of
`normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()` can directly use the saved genomic bins
and it ensures multiple use of `normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()` always
generate the matrices with the same rows.

That is basically everything, `normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()` generates
a matrix and you can use it directly with function `Heatmap()` or other heatmap-related
fucntions.

The following is the example I generated in my previous blog post, but here I
rewrite it with the use of `bin_genome()` and `normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins()`.


```{r, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "center"}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(circlize)
library(GenomicRanges)

chr_window = bin_genome("hg19")

#### the first is a numeric matrix #######
bed1 = generateRandomBed(nr = 1000, nc = 10)
gr1 = GRanges(seqnames = bed1[, 1], ranges = IRanges(bed1[, 2], bed1[, 3]))

num_mat = normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins(gr1, bed1[, -(1:3)])

#### the second is a character matrix ######
bed_list = lapply(1:10, function(i) {
    generateRandomBed(nr = 1000, nc = 1, 
        fun = function(n) sample(c("gain", "loss"), n, replace = TRUE))
})
char_mat = NULL
for(i in 1:10) {
    bed = bed_list[[i]]
    bed = bed[sample(nrow(bed), 20), , drop = FALSE]
    gr_cnv = GRanges(seqnames = bed[, 1], ranges = IRanges(bed[, 2], bed[, 3]))

    char_mat = cbind(char_mat, normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins(gr_cnv, bed[, 4]))
}

#### two numeric columns ##########
bed2 = generateRandomBed(nr = 100, nc = 2)
gr2 = GRanges(seqnames = bed2[, 1], ranges = IRanges(bed2[, 2], bed2[, 3]))

v = normalize_genomic_signals_to_bins(gr2, bed2[, 4:5])

##### a list of genes need to be marked
bed3 = generateRandomBed(nr = 40, nc = 0)
gr3 = GRanges(seqnames = bed3[, 1], ranges = IRanges(bed3[, 2], bed3[, 2]))
gr3$gene = paste0("gene_", 1:length(gr3))

mtch = as.matrix(findOverlaps(chr_window, gr3))
at = mtch[, 1]
labels = mcols(gr3)[mtch[, 2], 1]

##### order of the chromosomes ########
chr = as.vector(seqnames(chr_window))
chr_level = paste0("chr", c(1:22, "X", "Y"))
chr = factor(chr, levels = chr_level)

#### make the heatmap #######
subgroup = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 5)

ht_opt$TITLE_PADDING = unit(c(4, 4), "points")
ht_list = Heatmap(num_mat, name = "mat", col = colorRamp2(c(-1, 0, 1), c("green", "white", "red")),
        row_split = chr, cluster_rows = FALSE, show_column_dend = FALSE,
        column_split = subgroup, cluster_column_slices = FALSE,
        column_title = "numeric matrix",
        top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(subgroup = subgroup, annotation_name_side = "left"),
        row_title_rot = 0, row_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 10), border = TRUE,
        row_gap = unit(0, "points")) +
    Heatmap(char_mat, name = "CNV", col = c("gain" = "red", "loss" = "blue"),
        border = TRUE, column_title = "character matrix") +
    rowAnnotation(label = anno_mark(at = at, labels = labels)) +
    rowAnnotation(pt = anno_points(v, gp = gpar(col = 4:5), pch = c(1, 16)), 
        width = unit(2, "cm")) +
    rowAnnotation(bar = anno_barplot(v[, 1], gp = gpar(col = ifelse(v[ ,1] > 0, 2, 3))), 
        width = unit(2, "cm"))
draw(ht_list, merge_legend = TRUE)
