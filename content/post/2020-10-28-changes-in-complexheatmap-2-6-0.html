<p>The <strong>ComplexHeatmap</strong> package is still growing. Till now, there are 62
CRAN/Bioconductor packages that depend on ComplexHeatmap where 7 packages are also mine
:). It has approxiamtely <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/stats/bioc/ComplexHeatmap/">10k downloads per
month</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap/issues">600
issues</a> on GitHub and
nearly 600 GitHub stars. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/18/2847/1743594">The ComplexHeatmap
paper</a> has
more than 1100 citations. Thank you for liking ComplexHeatmap!</p>
<p>In version 2.6.0 which corresponds to the new Bioconductor release, there are
following major changes that are user-visible:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Add a <code>ComplexHeatmap::pheatmap()</code> function which is almost compatible to
<code>pheatmap::pheatmap()</code>. It helps users to seamlessly (I hope!) move from
<strong>pheatmap</strong> to <strong>ComplexHeatmap</strong> to use more unique features in
<strong>ComplexHeatmap</strong>, e.g. concatenating multiple heatmaps. See the blog post
<a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/2020/05/06/translate-from-pheatmap-to-complexheatmap/">“Translate from pheatmap to
ComplexHeatmap”</a>
for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>Support interactive heatmaps. Users can either do it under the interactive
graphics device or through a shiny app. See the blog post <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/2020/05/15/interactive-complexheatmap/">“Interactive
ComplexHeatmap”</a>
for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>Points can be added to the dendrogram nodes. <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/a-single-heatmap.html#render-dendrograms">See examples here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Rasterization has been improved and multiple methods for rasterization are
implemented. Now it supports <strong>magick</strong> package for better rasterization
and also <strong>ragg</strong> package for writting temporary png image files. See the
blog post <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/2020/06/30/rasterization-in-complexheatmap/">“Rasterization in
ComplexHeatmap”</a>
for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>Positions of column titles has been adjusted, so that it can be perfectly aligned with ggplot2 figures.
<a href="https://twitter.com/jokergoo_gu/status/1318824850748735489">See examples here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can rotate annotation names/labels. <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/heatmap-annotations.html#annotation-labels">Check examples
here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can choose how to group legends, which means legends for row annotations
can be grouped with column annotation legends. <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/legends.html#heatmap-and-annotation-legends">See examples
here</a>
(check the use of <code>legend_grouping</code> argument).</p></li>
<li><p><code>oncoPrint()</code> now draws legends the same as the graphics defined in <code>alter_fun</code>, which means
users do not need to manually construct legends for complex alteration types. <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/oncoprint.html">Check all the
legends in the oncoPrint chapter</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
