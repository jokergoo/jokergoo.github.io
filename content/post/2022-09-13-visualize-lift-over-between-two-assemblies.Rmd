```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    error = FALSE,
    tidy  = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.width = 8,
    fig.height = 8,
    fig.align = "center"
)
```

In this post, I will simply demonstrate how to visualize lift overs between two assemblies.
In the package **rtracklayer**, there is a function `liftOver()` that can convert genomic regions
according to the mapping encoded in a "chain" file.

In the following code, I will demonstrate the lift overs from hg19 to hg38. I first download
the chain file from UCSC database. Note the `.gz` file needs to be uncompressed.

```{r}
library(glue)
chain_file = "https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/liftOver/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz"
chain_file_basename = basename(chain_file)
tmp_dir = tempdir()
local_file = glue("{tmp_dir}/{chain_file_basename}")
download.file(chain_file, destfile = local_file)
system(glue("gzip -d -f '{local_file}'"))
```

Simply use `import.chain()` to create a `Chain` object.

```{r}
library(rtracklayer)
chain = import.chain(gsub("\\.gz$", "", local_file))
```

To establish the correspondance between hg19 and hg38, I split hg19 assembly by 5kb windows 
and I look for their corresponding regions in hg38.
Here `read.chromInfo()` returns the chromosome lengths of a genome. Of course you can use other ways
to obtain such information, such as `GenomicFeatures::getChromInfoFromUCSC("hg19")`.

```{r}
library(circlize)
genome_df = read.chromInfo(species = "hg19")$df
genome_gr = GRanges(seqnames = genome_df[, 1], ranges = IRanges(genome_df[, 2]+1, genome_df[, 3]))
```


And I split the genome by 5kb window.

```{r}
library(EnrichedHeatmap)
genome_bins = makeWindows(genome_gr, w = 5000)
```


Now I do the lift over. In `liftOver()`, I simply provide the regions in hg19 and the `Chain` object.

```{r}
to_bins = liftOver(genome_bins, chain)
to_bins
```

To reduce the numbers of mapped regions, if there are multiple regions in hg38 are mapped to the same 5kb window in hg19,
if the gap between then is less than 500bp, I just merge them. Also there might be some 5kb windows in hg19 have
no mapping in hg38. In the following code, I just remove these 5kb windows in hg19 having no mapping in hg38.

```{r}
to_bins = reduce(to_bins, min = 500)
n = sapply(start(to_bins), length)
l = n > 0
to_bins = to_bins[l]
genome_bins = genome_bins[l]
```

Now `genome_bin` contains a list of 5kb windows in hg19 and `to_bins` contains the mappings in hg38.
To visualize the relationships, I convert both objects to data frames. It is very easy to convert `genome_bin` to a data frame.

```{r}
df_from = as.data.frame(genome_bins)[, 1:3]
```

`to_bins` is a `GRanegsList` object because a 5kb window in hg19 may map to multiple regions in hg38. To simplify
the task, if a 5kb window in hg19 maps to multiple regions in hg38, I only use the first one.

It is not easy to get the chromosome name of the first region in every mapping. You can do
`sapply(sq, function(x) as.vector(x)[1])`, but it is actually very slow. In the
following code, I use the internal function `PartitioningByEnd()` to get the the index
of every first chromosome.

```{r}
sq = seqnames(to_bins)
pa = PartitioningByEnd(sq)
df_to = data.frame(
    chr = as.vector(unlist(sq))[start(pa)],
    start = sapply(start(to_bins), function(x) x[1]),
    end = sapply(end(to_bins), function(x) x[1])
)
```

I restrict the chromosomes to "normal chromosomes":

```{r}
from_chromosomes = paste0("chr", c(1:22, "X", "Y"))
to_chromosomes = paste0("chr", c(1:22, "X", "Y"))

l = df_from[, 1] %in% from_chromosomes & df_to[, 1] %in% to_chromosomes
df_from = df_from[l, ]
df_to = df_to[l, ]
```

Now let's check the value of `df_from` (hg19) and `df_to` (hg38):

```{r}
head(df_from)
head(df_to)
```

And the number of regions remains:

```{r}
nrow(df_from)
nrow(df_to)
```

The data is ready, next I can make the circular plot. I first extract
the chromosome lengths for both assemblies.


```{r}
from_chromInfo = read.chromInfo(species = "hg19")$df
from_chromInfo = from_chromInfo[from_chromInfo[, 1] %in% from_chromosomes, ]

to_chromInfo = read.chromInfo(species = "hg38")$df
to_chromInfo = to_chromInfo[to_chromInfo[, 1] %in% to_chromosomes, ]
```

Since I will put two assemblies in one plot, and the two assemblies are all for human,
I add prefix `"from_"` and `"to_"` to distinguish them.

```{r}
from_chromInfo[ ,1] = paste0("from_", from_chromInfo[, 1])
to_chromInfo[ ,1] = paste0("to_", to_chromInfo[, 1])
chromInfo = rbind(from_chromInfo, to_chromInfo)
```

Similiarly, I add the prefix to `df_from` and `df_to`.

```{r}
df_from[, 1] = paste0("from_", df_from[, 1])
df_to[, 1] = paste0("to_", df_to[, 1])
```


`chromInfo` contains chromosome lengths for both hg19 and hg38 and it can be thought as a "combined" genome,
where e.g. `"from_chr1"` and `"to_chr1"` are two different chromosomes. In the final circular plot, for easy correspondance
between two assemblies, I will let chr1 for both assemblies close in the plot and chrX/chrY also close in the plot.
In this case, I need to manually control the chromosome orders.

I just need to reverse the order of `to_chromosomes`. The chromosome orders are encoded as "levels" of the first column
in `chromInfo`.

```{r}
chromosome.index = c(paste0("from_", from_chromosomes), paste0("to_", rev(to_chromosomes))) 
chromInfo[, 1] = factor(chromInfo[ ,1], levels = chromosome.index)
```

Next I use **circlize** package to visualize the lift overs. If you know **circlize**, the following
code is very straightforward to understand. Note here I randomly sampled 10000 regions for visualization.

```{r}
library(circlize)
circos.par(gap.after = c(rep(1, length(from_chromosomes) - 1), 5, rep(1, length(to_chromosomes) - 1), 5))
circos.genomicInitialize(chromInfo, plotType = NULL)

circos.track(ylim = c(0, 1), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
    circos.text(CELL_META$xcenter, CELL_META$ylim[2] + mm_y(2), 
        gsub(".*chr", "", CELL_META$sector.index), cex = 0.6, niceFacing = TRUE)
}, track.height = mm_h(1), cell.padding = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg.border = NA)

circos.track(ylim = c(0, 1), cell.padding = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg.border = NA, bg.col = "grey", track.height = mm_h(1))

highlight.chromosome(paste0("from_", from_chromosomes), col = "red", track.index = 1)
highlight.chromosome(paste0("to_", to_chromosomes), col = "blue", track.index = 1)

ind = sample(nrow(df_from), 10000)
col = rand_color(length(to_chromosomes))
names(col) = paste0("to_", to_chromosomes)
circos.genomicLink(df_from[ind, ], df_to[ind, ], col = add_transparency(col[df_to[ind, 1]], 0.9))

circos.clear()

text(0.9, -0.9, "hg19")
text(0.9, 0.9, "hg38")
```

It looks nice, but there is one limit in the plot. I reversed the chromosome order for hg38 which are on the top half
of the circle. The chromosomes for hg38 are reverse clockwise, but the x-axes on the hg38 chromosomes are still 
clockwise, which makes the links twisted. To improve the visualization, I manually reverse the x-axes of hg38 chromosomes
with a simple transformation by the following code:

```{r}
# `to` genome is put on the top of the circle, where the x-axis is reversed
gsize = structure(chromInfo[, 3], names = as.vector(chromInfo[, 1]))
df_to[, 2] = gsize[df_to[, 1]] - df_to[, 2]
df_to[, 3] = gsize[df_to[, 1]] - df_to[, 3]
df_to[, 2:3] = df_to[, 3:2]
```

I make the plot with the same code, and I explicitely add two arrows to represent the directions of x-axes. Now
it looks better!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
circos.par(gap.after = c(rep(1, length(from_chromosomes) - 1), 5, rep(1, length(to_chromosomes) - 1), 5))
circos.genomicInitialize(chromInfo, plotType = NULL)

circos.track(ylim = c(0, 1), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
    circos.text(CELL_META$xcenter, CELL_META$ylim[2] + mm_y(2), 
        gsub(".*chr", "", CELL_META$sector.index), cex = 0.6, niceFacing = TRUE)
}, track.height = mm_h(1), cell.padding = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg.border = NA)
circos.track(ylim = c(0, 1), cell.padding = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg.border = NA, bg.col = "grey", track.height = mm_h(1))
highlight.chromosome(paste0("from_", from_chromosomes), 
    col = "red", track.index = 1)
highlight.chromosome(paste0("to_", to_chromosomes), 
    col = "blue", track.index = 1)

circos.genomicLink(df_from[ind, ], df_to[ind, ], col = add_transparency(col[df_to[ind, 1]], 0.9))

set.current.cell(sector.index = paste0("from_", from_chromosomes[round(length(from_chromosomes)*1/5)]), track.index = 1)
circos.arrow(CELL_META$xlim[1], CELL_META$xlim[1] + mm_x(20), 
    y = 10, col = "grey")

set.current.cell(sector.index = paste0("to_", to_chromosomes[round(length(to_chromosomes)*1/5)]), track.index = 1)
circos.arrow(CELL_META$xlim[2], CELL_META$xlim[2]- mm_x(20), 
    y = 10, col = "grey")

circos.clear()

text(0.9, -0.9, "hg19")
text(0.9, 0.9, "hg38")
```

Finally I have wrapped the code into a function which can be found at https://gist.github.com/jokergoo/4161997c2a60ac90ae57017b19aea81e.
In the function `viz_lift_over()` you just specifiy two genome IDs, e.g.,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
viz_lift_over("mm9", "mm10")
```

## Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
