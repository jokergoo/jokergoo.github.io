title: "Reverse x-axis in the circular layout"

In **circlize** package, x-axis in always clockwise in each sector, no matter it
is on the top of the circle or at the bottom. However, you can manually reverse
the original positions on x-axis to pretend you have a reversed x-axis. Take following example:

```{r, echo = -2}
library(circlize)
circos.clear()
circos.par(gap.degree = c(10, 10), start.degree = -5)
circos.initialize(factors = c("a", "b"), xlim = c(0, 1))
circos.trackPlotRegion(ylim = c(0, 1), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
	circos.axis(major.at = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1))
})
circos.rect(0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, col = "red", sector.index = "a")
circos.link("a", 0.3, "b", 0.7)
circos.clear()
```

In the bottom sector, the order of x-axis seems not very convinient to read.
Actually we can make some transformation on the original coordinates on x-axis.
In following we defined `reverse_xaxis()` which flips the x-axis.

```{r}
reverse_xaxis = function(x, xlim = get.cell.meta.data("xlim")) {
	(xlim[2] - xlim[1]) - (x - xlim[1]) + xlim[1]
}
reverse_xaxis(seq(0, 1, by = 0.1), xlim = c(0, 1))
```

In the arguments of `reverse_xaxis()`, the default value for `xlim` is `get.cell.meta.data("xlim")` 
so that it can automatically get the ranges on x-axis if `reverse_xaxis()` is called inside `panel.fun()`.
If it is called somewhere else, `xlim` should be defined explicitly.

Now we apply `reverse_xaxis()` to all the coordinates in the sectors we want to
flip.

```{r}
circos.par(gap.degree = c(10, 10), start.degree = -5)
circos.initialize(factors = c("a", "b"), xlim = c(0, 1))
circos.trackPlotRegion(ylim = c(0, 1), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
	sector.index = get.cell.meta.data("sector.index")
	at = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)
	if(sector.index == "a") {
		circos.axis(major.at = at, labels = reverse_xaxis(at))
		circos.rect(reverse_xaxis(0.2), 0.2, reverse_xaxis(0.4), 0.4, 
			col = "red", sector.index = "a")
	} else {
		circos.axis(major.at = at)
	}
})
xlim = get.cell.meta.data("xlim", sector.index = "a")
circos.link("a", reverse_xaxis(0.3, xlim), "b", 0.7)
circos.clear()
```

In the end, I want to say that users should be very careful with reversing the x-axes. The default
design that all x-axes are clockwise actually makes it easy and straightforward to compare between sectors,
especially when you have many sectors in the circle.
